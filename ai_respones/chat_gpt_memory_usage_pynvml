When using pynvml my memory usage after running a model.generate is lower than expected
Good observation ‚Äî that‚Äôs actually a fairly common situation when measuring GPU memory with `pynvml`.

Let‚Äôs go through **why this happens** and what you can check to confirm what‚Äôs going on.

---

### üß† What‚Äôs likely happening

After you call `model.generate(...)`:

1. **PyTorch frees temporary allocations** used during generation (e.g., activations, attention caches, or buffers).

   * PyTorch uses a **caching allocator** for GPU memory.
   * After generation, some memory may be released back to PyTorch‚Äôs pool, **but not to the GPU driver**, so `pynvml` may show **lower or unchanged** memory usage depending on timing and caching state.

2. **Lazy synchronization:**
   If you check memory usage immediately after `generate()` but before calling `torch.cuda.synchronize()`, some kernels may not have finished. Memory stats can therefore be misleadingly low.

3. **`model.generate` offloads tensors to CPU** when `use_cache=False` or for certain sampling settings (like beam search with logits processors). This reduces GPU usage dynamically.

4. **`pynvml` reports total allocated memory by CUDA driver**, not necessarily what PyTorch is caching internally.

### ‚úÖ How to measure GPU memory correctly

Here are a few reliable methods:

#### 1. Force synchronization

```python
torch.cuda.synchronize()
```

Then check:

```python
import pynvml
pynvml.nvmlInit()
handle = pynvml.nvmlDeviceGetHandleByIndex(0)
info = pynvml.nvmlDeviceGetMemoryInfo(handle)
print(f"Used memory: {info.used / 1024**2:.2f} MB")
```

#### 2. Use PyTorch‚Äôs own allocator stats

```python
print(f"Allocated: {torch.cuda.memory_allocated() / 1e6:.1f} MB")
print(f"Reserved: {torch.cuda.memory_reserved() / 1e6:.1f} MB")
```

* **`allocated`** = tensors currently holding memory.
* **`reserved`** = memory held in PyTorch‚Äôs pool, even if unused.

This usually gives a clearer picture than `pynvml`.

#### 3. Profile peak usage

If you want the **maximum memory** used during generation:

```python
torch.cuda.reset_peak_memory_stats()
_ = model.generate(...)
torch.cuda.synchronize()
print(f"Peak memory: {torch.cuda.max_memory_allocated() / 1e6:.1f} MB")
```

### üîç Example reason your number looks ‚Äútoo low‚Äù

Let‚Äôs say:

* Model loads = 500 MB
* Generate uses 1.5 GB at peak
* After generation, activations are freed, leaving only the model weights.

Then `pynvml` might show:

```
Before: 500 MB
During: 2000 MB
After: 600 MB
```

So if you only check **after**, it looks ‚Äúlower than expected,‚Äù but that‚Äôs because temporary buffers were released.

### üß© If you want to *see* the full memory curve

You can sample during generation:

```python
import time

mems = []
for _ in range(10):
    info = pynvml.nvmlDeviceGetMemoryInfo(handle)
    mems.append(info.used / 1e6)
    time.sleep(0.1)

print(mems)
```

Or better yet, wrap generation in `torch.profiler` to record memory usage dynamically.

If you want, you can share your measurement code ‚Äî I can help you adjust it so you get accurate readings for both **active** and **peak** GPU memory during `generate()`. Would you like me to?


  This helped me use the peak memory to examine how much memory was being used when running the models
